-- Looking for SPARTA in the conda environment: '/home/shobhit/miniconda3'
CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:24 (find_package):
  By not providing "FindSparta.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "Sparta", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "Sparta" with any
  of the following names:

    SpartaConfig.cmake
    sparta-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "Sparta" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "Sparta_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "Sparta"
  provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been
  installed.
